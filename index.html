Sanjeeva Balasuriya has over 25 years experience as a leading mathematics educator and researcher, at universities across four continents.
<br><br>
 His research encompasses many areas of mathematics and their applications, with publications  in
journals such as <em> SIAM Review, </em> <em> Physical Review Letters, </em> <em> Journal of Theoretical
Biology, </em> <em> Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics, </em>  <em> Nonlinearity, </em> <em> Journal
of Computational Dynamics, </em> <em> Combustion Theory and Modelling, </em> <em> Physica D, </em> <em> SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems, </em> <em> Scientific Reports </em> and
<em> Journal of Fluid Mechanics, </em> as well as a sole-author monograph in the area of applied analysis published by the Society of Industrial
and Applied Mathematics.   His awards include a Future Fellowship from the Australian Research
Council, the Endeavour Research Leadership Award from the Australian Commonwealth Department of Education and
Training, and the Stella Dafermos Award from Brown University.
<br><br>
Sanjeeva's extensive teaching experiences include 100+ course offerings in mathematics, statistics and data;  undergraduate and postgraduate; large service and small project-based; application-dominant to theoretical
mathematics; mathematics enrichment for humanities students to specialized research courses.  He has been a leader in mathematical
pedagogy in areas such as mathematical motivation, student-centred learning, project-based courses, peer-assessed
teaching tools, accessing higher cognitive levels in the Bloom taxonomy, leveraging learning management systems
for innovative engagement, and writing in mathematics; and even had 
an article in the <em> Mathematical Association of America Focus Magazine </em> (2008) on a method for flipping a Real Analysis course before the term ''flipping'' was even known!  He has also led curriculum development efforts at the program level, including at a joint Australian-Chinese undergraduate college.  As the Director (a.k.a. Associate Dean) of Learning and Teaching at the Faculty of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences (University of Adelaide; 2020--2022), he led significant efforts in modifications to course delivery and examinations during a time of turmoil.
