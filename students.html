<p align="left"> <font color="993388"> <b> Postgraduate research topics </b>
</font> </p>

<p> I have "principal supervisor" status at the University of Adelaide, through which I am able to offer a range of 
postgraduate projects, each of which has the potential of balancing theoretical, computational and applied aspects
in ratios according to the student's interests and experience.  Some of these projects are offshoots of collaborations
with colleagues elsewhere.  An incomplete list of postgraduate research thesis topics I would be interested in offering
is: </p>

<ul>

<li> Quantifying and optimising flow within floating liquid micro-marbles used for cell culture  <font size=-1>  (based on a project with
<a href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/science-aviation/queensland-micro-nanotechnology-centre/staff/prof-nam-trung-nguyen">
Nam-Trung Nguyen, </a> Queensland Micro- and Nanotechnology Centre) and
<a href="http://maths.adelaide.edu.au/people/trent.mattner"> Trent Mattner </a> (University of Adelaide) </font>

<li> Data-driven dynamical systems

<li> Controlling stable and unstable manifolds in fluid flows 

<li> Defining and quantifying uncertainty of stable and unstable manifolds under small stochasticity
 <font size=-1>  (based on a project with <a href="http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/gottwald/">  Georg Gottwald, </a>
University of Sydney) </font>

<li> Assimilating satellite measurements of ocean heights and temperatures to determine velocity corrections to oceanic velocity data  <font size=-1>  (based on a project with <a href="http://lgge.osug.fr/personnels/Lesommer_Julien/"> Julien Le Sommer </a>
and <a href="https://skyros.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr/~dovidio/"> Francesco d'Ovidio, </a> CNRS) </font>

<li> Development of theoretical Melnikov techniques for locating flow barriers and assessing transport in three-dimensional unsteady flows 

<li> Analysis of flow barriers in unsteady turbulent velocity data  <font size=-1>  (based on a project with
<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~nto/"> Nick Ouellette, </a> Stanford University) </font>

<li> Development of theoretical methodology for transport enhancement in microfluidic channels, with numerical (computational fluid dynamics) validation   <font size=-1>  (based on a project with <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~zhilin/">  Zhilin Li, </a> North Carolina State University) </font>

<li> Defining and analysing stable and unstable manifolds in finite-time flows

<li> Defining and assessing minimum flux curves and surfaces in flows subject to diffusion
 <font size=-1>  (based on a project with <a href="http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~froyland/">  Gary Froyland,
</a> University of New South Wales) </font>


<li> Determining wavespeeds and profiles of travelling waves in reaction-diffusion/ecological systems subject to time-delay

</ul>

<p> I am also able to supervise postgraduate theses of other topics related to my research expertise; please see my 
<a href="http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/sanjeeva.balasuriya/research.html"> Research </a>
and  <a href="http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/sanjeeva.balasuriya/publish.html"> Publications </a> pages.  I am happy to 
speak with such students face-to-face (if that is practicable), or via
email, to decide on whether a mutually acceptable postgraduate research problem can be formulated.  Prospective students
will eventually need to be able to enunciate their research programme in their application for studentship and funding,
so please <em> be prepared with some initial thoughts </em> before you talk to me.
</p>

<br>

<p align="left"> <font color="993388"> <b> Honours projects </b>
</font> </p>

<p> I am happy to supervise honours projects in many areas of applied mathematics, with the project taking on
theoretical, computational or applied flavours (or a combination) depending on students' interests and training.
 Prospective students are
invited to peruse my webpages to see what areas I am interested in; I am also happy to supervise honours projects
in allied areas.   I have in the past supervised honours projects
(or equivalently, advised "senior seminars" or "senior theses" within the US context) in chaotic mixing, difference equations in
genetics, existence and uniqueness in stochastic differential equations, sparse coding, mathematical models for the
Eiffel Tower, fractal sets and their connectivity, Solow growth models in economics, Hilbert spaces, the mathematics of rowing, 
Green's functions, wavelets, stability in delay differential equations, and chaotic behaviour of financial markets.  As possible topics for prospective honours
students, I can offer the following nonexhaustive list; please talk to me if you are interested in something different.  </p>
<ul> 
<li> Chaotic mixing in fluid flows
<li> Optimising transport in microfluidic devices
<li> Invisible flow barriers in the ocean
<li> Stable and unstable manifolds in time-varying flows
<li> Melnikov theory for quantifying invariant manifolds
<li> Flame speeds of reaction-diffusion combustion waves
<li> Invasion speeds of flora and fauna based on reaction-diffusion models
<li> Differential equations models for solid tumour spreading
<li> Modelling phytoplankton blooms
<li> Ecological and environmental modelling
<li> Modelling pollution
<li> Other applications of ordinary differential equations
<li> Impulsive differential equations 
<li> Stochastic perturbations to differential equations
<li> Minimum flux surfaces/curves in fluid flows
<li> Numerical computation of stable and unstable manifolds in nonautonomous flows
</ul>

<p>
 The relevant qualification for entry into these research postgraduate
degrees at the University of Adelaide is normally an excellent honours degree from an Australian university, or an equivalent foreign qualification.  Foreign students should note that (i) an Australian honours degree is essentially equivalent to a US Masters degree,
and (ii) a PhD in Australia is typically a three-year research-only 
programme which has no coursework.  Therefore, foreign students entering the PhD programme at Adelaide usually have at least a Masters-level qualification.  An alternative research degree is the two-year coursework+research MPhil degree, which might be 
more appropriate for foreign students holding only a Bachelors degree. </p>

<p>
All students, domestic or international, will need to complete the formal application process for entry into a postgraduate 
research degree (that is, PhD or MPhil).  Domestic students may qualify for funding through Australian
Postgraduate Awards, while international students will need to pursue other options for funding.  Please explore the above links
to determine the possible sources of funding/scholarships, and to find information on the applications process and funding.  If
applying for scholarships, prospective students will need to prepare their research statement in conjunction with their
supervisor. </p>
