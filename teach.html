<text class="fontverdana">
Sanjeeva has extensive undergraduate and postgraduate teaching experience, acquired through teaching a variety of courses with different expectations, at top liberal arts colleges in the US as well as at research universities.  These courses run the gamut from large lectures to hundreds of students to small courses
with two students, from examination-driven to project-driven, from chalk-and-talk to activity-based student-centred,
from purely theoretical to very applied, from highly reliant on technology to strongly reliant on intuition, from
mathematics for engineering to mathematics for the humanities.  He has been at the forefront of many 
"hot" ideas in teaching: activity- and discovery-based learning, peer assessment, open-book and 
take-home examinations, student-run classes, flipping classrooms in various ways, project-driven courses, 
technology-enabled peer-instruction, etc, and has also developed course- and instructor-evaluation tools. 
<br><br>
Over the past 25+ years, Sanjeeva has developed curricula at the course level for many courses. In addition,
he has coordinated programs (at the degree level) at an international joint college, 
 and overseen teaching activities as a Director (a.k.a. Associate Dean) of Learning and Teaching.  In this latter role,
 he has managed both the teaching (evaluating and reporting on teaching and courses, awarding high-performing
 teachers, managing and formulating policies) and the learning (providing support to under-performing students) sides.

<div class="sectionheader"> Curriculum development (selected)  </div>
<ul>
<li> <font color="aa00aa"> Environmental Modeling </font> (Connecticut College) was developed as a cross-listed course
between Mathematics and Environmental Studies.  This included modeling of biological systems (as 
pertaining to predation, competition, invasive species and endangered species), as well as climate, 
weather and pollutant spreading modeling (incorporating the IPCC reports). 
<li> <font color="aa00aa"> Fourier Transforms and Applications </font> (University of Adelaide) was developed for students in the
"Advanced" stream of mathematics, such that <em> all </em> material was presented through discovery-based
learning.  Carefully guided worksheets were often used with students working in groups (different groups each time), 
in addition to more open-ended questions and assignments, and computational exercises.  <a href="/syllabi/AMPII_syllabus.pdf"> [syllabus] </a> 
<li> <font color="aa00aa"> Calculus with Precalculus </font> (Connecticut College) was developed to take students who had 
not had a precalculus course all the way to differential and integral calculus in just one semester.  No concepts 
were presented without providing intuitive justifications.  To achieve this, a careful development of material not
available in any one textbook was necessary; instructor-developed material was provided in addition to judicious
choices from two different textbooks, with thoughtful instructions to help students to use this material as references
in a nonconfusing way.  <a href="/syllabi/MAT111_syllabus.pdf"> [syllabus] </a>
<li> An extensive collection of lecture materials, plus a full textbook, was written for <font color="aa00aa"> Mathematics IB: Calculus </font> (University of Adelaide), where the emphasis was on (i) presenting material in an active-learning fashion whenever
possible, despite the 600 students in the course, and (ii) having material which could be transferred to any other
lecturer in subsequent years.  The lecture slides had embedded activities within them, which utilized on-time
polling (prior to the presence of tools such as Mentimeter) as well as time during which students would tackle (in groups and singly) certain tasks which led to the
concepts.  <a href="/syllabi/MATHS1B_1s7.pdf"> [sample lecture slides] </a>
<li> The joint curriculum development of Math 240: Introduction to Mathematical Modelling (Oberlin College, 2001), a course
amalgamating modelling aspects from differential equations, optimization and statistics, was undertaken via a
National Science Foundation Award for the Integration of Research and Education grant.
<li> As program-coordinator for mathematics for <a href="http://haide.ouc.edu.cn/hdenglish/ABOUTHAIDE/list.htm"> Haide College, </a> a joint initiative between Ocean University of China and the University of Adelaide based in Shandong (China), oversight of the entire mathematics degree programme, its curriculum, and its articulation pathways (2020-). 
<li> A methodology developed by Sanjeeva for incorporating a flipped model (before the term "flipped" was
coined) for a theoretical mathematics course,
<font color="aa00aa"> Real Analysis </font> (Connecticut College) is detailed in a teaching-related publication:

<div class="sectionheader"> Student evaluations (selected)  </div>

In <em> all </em> student evaluations which discernibly asked for an overall score for the instructor, the median score
awarded by students to Sanjeeva has always been the maximum available (e.g., if the students had to chose from the
range 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for an overall ranking for the instructor, at least half the students would chose 5, the maximum allowable).

<font size=-2> Comment: This is a course in the covid-era.  In-class lectures were revamped completely to provide recordings,
weekly tasks (online tutorials and quizzes) were developed, assignments were graded online and most importantly,
all examinations were conducted online.  In a significant move in an environment in which even open-book examinations
had not been held pre-covid, the online examinations were made <em> open-internet, </em> allowing students to use
<em> any </em> inanimate resources (books, websites, etc).  While this was precipitated by covid restrictions, this was
taken as an opportunity to pose quite different types of questions with less convergent solutions and which appealed to
higher levels in the Bloom taxonomy.  Assignments were adjusted similarly to help students adapt to thinking deeper, 
while preparing for the style of the examinations.

<font size=-2> Comment: These evaluations reflect the related issues - which had been discussed within both Mathematics and
Environmental Studies - as to whether Calculus I would need to be a prerequisite or not, and whether MAT205 would qualify
for satisfying the general education requirement in mathematics.  In view of this feedback, Calculus I would 
need to be specified as a firm prerequisite for this course to be most effective. </font>

feedback on my teaching and courses.  Several colleagues at Sydney subsequently adopted this form designed by Sanjeeva for their own courses. </font>
