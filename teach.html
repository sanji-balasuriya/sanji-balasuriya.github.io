<text class="fontverdana">
Sanjeeva has extensive undergraduate and postgraduate teaching experience, acquired through teaching a variety of courses with different expectations, at top liberal arts colleges in the US as well as at research universities.  These courses run the gamut from large lectures to hundreds of students to small courses
with two students, from examination-driven to project-driven, from chalk-and-talk to activity-based student-centred,
from purely theoretical to very applied, from highly reliant on technology to strongly reliant on intuition, from
mathematics for engineering to mathematics for the humanities.  He has been at the forefront of many 
"hot" ideas in teaching: activity- and discovery-based learning, peer assessment, open-book and 
take-home examinations, student-run classes, flipping classrooms in various ways, project-driven courses, 
technology-enabled peer-instruction, etc, and has also developed course- and instructor-evaluation tools. 
<br><br>
Over the past 25+ years, Sanjeeva has developed curricula at the course level for many courses. In addition,
he has coordinated programs (at the degree level) at an international joint college, 
 and overseen teaching activities as a Director (a.k.a. Associate Dean) of Learning and Teaching.  In this latter role,
 he has managed both the teaching (evaluating and reporting on teaching and courses, awarding high-performing
 teachers, managing and formulating policies) and the learning (providing support to under-performing students) sides.

</font> </em> </p>
<ul>
<li> <em> Environmental Modeling </em> (Connecticut College) was developed as a cross-listed course
between Mathematics and Environmental Studies.  This included modeling of biological systems (as 
pertaining to predation, competition, invasive species and endangered species), as well as climate and
weather modeling (incorporating the IPCC reports). 
<li> <em> Fourier Transforms and Applications </em> (University of Adelaide) was developed for students in the
"Advanced" stream of mathematics, such that <em> all </em> material was presented through discovery-based
learning.  Carefully guided worksheets were often used with students working in groups (different groups each time), 
in addition to more open-ended questions and assignments, and computational exercises.  <a href="/syllabi/AMPII_syllabus> [syllabus] </a> 
<li> <em> Calculus with Precalculus </em> (Connecticut College) was developed to take students who had 
not had a precalculus course all the way to differential and integral calculus in just one semester.  No concepts 
were presented without providing intuitive justifications.  To achieve this, a careful development of material not
available in any one textbook was necessary; instructor-developed material was provided in addition to carefully
chosen parts from two different textbooks.  <a href="/syllabi/MAT111_syllabus.pdf"> [syllabus] </a>
<li> An extensive collection of lecture materials, plus a full textbook, was written for <em> Mathematics IB: Calculus </em> (University of Adelaide), where the emphasis was on (i) presenting material in an active-learning fashion whenever
possible, despite the 600 students in the course, and (ii) having material which could be transferred to any other
lecturer in subsequent years.  The lecture slides had embedded activities within them, which utilized on-time
polling as well as time during which students would tackle (in groups and singly) certain tasks which led to the
concepts.  <a href="/syllabi/MATHS1B_s1p7.pdf"> [sample lecture slides] </a>
<li> A methodology developed by Sanjeeva for incorporating a flipped model (before the term "flipped" was
coined) for a theoretical mathematics course,
<em> Real Analysis </em> (Connecticut College) is detailed in a teaching-related publication: <a href="https://sanji-balasuriya.github.io/papers/teaching_time_savers.pdf">
Reacting to Analysis </a><font size=-2><em> MAA Focus </em> <b> 28, </b> 8-9 (2008)</font>
</ul> 

<br>
<br>

<p align="left"> <em> <font color="770077" size=+1> <b> Student evaluations (selected)  </b>
</font> </em> </p>
In <em> all </em> student evaluations which discernibly asked for an overall score for the instructor, the median score
awarded by students to Sanjeeva has always been the maximum available (e.g., if the students had to chose from the
range 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for an overall ranking for the instructor, at least half the students would chose 5, the maximum allowable).
