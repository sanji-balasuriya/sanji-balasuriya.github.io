<p align="left"> <font color="993388"> <b> Current teaching (Semester 2, 2022) </b>
</font> </p>

<p> This semester, I am teaching a Honours/Postgraduate course titled "Nonlinear Analysis of Dynamical
Systems" which is cross-listed between Pure and Applied Mathematics.  Enrolled students can access the course website
via the University's MyUni page.
</p>
<br>


<p align="left"> <font color="993388"> <b> Teaching profile </b>
</font> </p>

<p> I have extensive teaching experience, acquired through teaching a variety of courses with different expectations
across three continents.  These courses run the gamut from large lectures to hundreds of students to small courses
with two students, from examination-driven to project-driven, from chalk-and-talk to activity-based student-centred,
from purely theoretical to very applied, from highly reliant on technology to strongly reliant on intuition, from
mathematics for engineering to mathematics for the humanities.  I have, for many years, developed curricula
for and employed currently
"hot" ideas in teaching: activity- and discovery-based learning, peer assessment, open-book and 
take-home examinations, student-run classes, flipping classrooms in various ways, project-driven courses, 
technology-enabled peer-instruction, etc, and have also developed course- and instructor-evaluation tools.  </p>

<p>  I have taught at Brown University (USA), the University of Sydney, the
University of Adelaide, the University of Peradeniya (Sri Lanka), Oberlin College (USA) and Connecticut College (USA).  The last two of these are "liberal
arts" undergraduate institutions, renowned for their teaching excellence and broad-based education.  These institutions
provide innovative pedagogy and curricula in
small class settings, and attract excellent undergraduates.  I owe a lot of my teaching expertise and reputation to 
the insight gained at these colleges, and to interactions with colleagues and students everywhere that I have taught.  </p>

<br>

<p align="left"> <font color="993388"> <b> Courses taught </b>

<p>I have taught across the curriculum, from undergraduate courses for non-specialists to honours and masters level courses.
A rough idea of the numbers of courses I have taught is given below. </p>

<p> I have extensive experience in curriculum development, both at the level of individual courses, and in serving in
institutional committees with a broader oversight.  Courses to which I have brought a particularly new flavour include (i) a
course on "environmental modelling" which was cross-listed between mathematics and environmental studies, (ii) a one-semester
course "calculus with precalculus" which covers both differentiation and integration, 
aimed at students from 
non-physical science backgrounds who have not covered precalculus topics previously and yet insists on providing intuition
for every aspect covered, and (iii) a honours and postgraduate course in nonlinear dynamics which was cross-listed between pure and applied mathematics, which allowed students to individualise their interests by venturing more deeply
into one or the other area.

</font> </p>


<p> I am an advisor/trainer of the University of Adelaide teams participating at the
<a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/"> Mathematical Contest in Modeling, </a> a US-based
annual international competition for undergraduates held every February.   Team members need to be collectively
skilled in mathematics, computation, modelling and scientific writing; should you be interested in participating in this
invigorating but challenging contest, please contact me. </p>

Congratulations to both teams which participated in 2015: <br>
<br>
<ul> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"> The team of Alex Tam  and  Parsa Kavkani <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2015/results/"> were Outstanding Winners of the contest, and were awarded the INFORMS Prize. </a>  
They were one of only five teams selected as Outstanding Winners out of 5356 entries for the problem (on the
spreading of Ebola) that they tackled.  They are the first ever Australian team to have emerged a winner in this contest.
<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;"> The team of Leon Chea, Susan Pang and Helen Geng were awarded Meritorious status, coming in the top 9%.
